Here we are at Lyons’, and we will each of us","pay for our own. That’s it!” And Tuppence led the way upstairs.","","The place was full, and they wandered about looking for a table,","catching odds and ends of conversation as they did so.","","“And--do you know, she sat down and _cried_ when I told her she couldn’t","have the flat after all.” “It was simply a _bargain_, my dear!

She wore a small bright green toque over her black bobbed hair,","and her extremely short and rather shabby skirt revealed a pair of","uncommonly dainty ankles. Her appearance presented a valiant attempt at","smartness.","","The tea came at last, and Tuppence, rousing herself from a fit of","meditation, poured it out.","","“Now then,” said Tommy, taking a large bite of bun, “let’s get","up-to-date.
